<p>I am a lover of books and a player of soccer.
Child of God, redeemed by grace. Writer of stories, weaver of dreams. I am, 
image bearer, story teller, Keeper of hope, friend of fantasy, and believer 
in Christ.</p>

<h4>Something a little mor concrete</h4>

<p>My name is Annathina. I have eight
siblings, of which I am the youngest, save one. As of fall 2016, I am officially a 
student of Bob Jones University. I am majoring in creative writing because I
love to create. The written word,the printed page, they give me so much
opportunity to create worlds of my own. That being said,punctuation is my 
enemy. Also: numbers make no sense to me.</p>
<p>After starting school, I joined a <a href="http://www.bju.edu/life-faith/get-involved/societies.php">society</a>, this year, and for the frest of my 
college career, I hope to play intermural soccer with the rest of my society 
team. I don't claim to be good, but I have a lot of fun. I love to read, so I 
used to spend a lot of my free time at the <a href="http://www.greenvillelibrary.org">local library.</a> Now that I'm a college 
student, I never have free time.</p>
